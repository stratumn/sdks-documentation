The following functionality will no longer be supported in future releases.

### Requesting the transfer of ownership of a trace

You can "push" the trace to another group in the workflow this way:

<Tabs
groupId="choosen-language"
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="js">

```js
await sdk.pushTrace({
  prevLink, // or traceId
  recipient: YOUR_CONFIG.otherGroup,
  data: {
    why: "because",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="csharp">

```cs
IDictionary<string, object> data = new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "why", "because im testing the pushTrace 2" } };

PushTransferInput<object> push = new PushTransferInput<object>(TraceId, recipient, data, prevLink);
someTraceState = await GetSdk().PushTraceAsync<object>(push);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```java
Map<String, Object> data =new HashMap<String, Object>( Collections.singletonMap("why", "because I'm testing the pushTrace 2"));

PushTransferInput<Object> push = new PushTransferInput<Object>(recipient, data, prevLink);
someTraceState = sdk.pushTrace<Object>(push);

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The arguments are:

- `recipient`: the id of the group to push the trace to,
- `data`: (optional) some data related to the push transfer,
- `prevLink` or `traceId`.

You can also "pull" an existing trace from another group:

<Tabs
groupId="choosen-language"
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="js">

```js
await sdk.pullTrace({
  prevLink, // or traceId
  data: {
    why: "because",
  },
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="csharp">

```cs
IDictionary<string, string> data = new Dictionary<string, string>() { { "why", "because im testing the pushTrace 2" } };

PullTransferInput<object> pull = new PullTransferInput<object>(TraceId, data, prevLink);
TraceState<object, object> statepul = await GetSdk().PullTraceAsync(pull);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```java
Map<String, Object> data =new HashMap<String, Object>( Collections.singletonMap("why", "because I'm testing the pushTrace 2"));
PullTransferInput<Object> pull = new PullTransferInput<Object>(TraceId, data, prevLink);
TraceState<Object, Object> statepul =  sdk.pullTrace(pull);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

And in this case, the arguments are:

- `data`: (optional) some data related to the pull transfer,
- `prevLink` or `traceId`.

The Sdk will return the new state object of the trace. The shape of this object is the same as explained [previously](#creating-a-new-trace).

Notes:

- In both cases, the trace is not transferred automatically to or from the group. The recipient must respond to your request as we will see in the [next section](#responding-to-a-transfer-of-ownership-of-a-trace).
- You don't need to provide a `recipient` in the case of a `pullTransfer` since the two parties of the transfer can be inferred (you and the current owner of the trace).
- The `data` object argument is optional. When it is provided, it is a free form object that will not be validated against a JSON schema.

### Responding to a transfer of ownership of a trace

When someone pushed a trace to your group, you can either accept or reject the transfer:

<Tabs
groupId="choosen-language"
  defaultValue="js"
  values={[
    { label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
    { label: 'C#', value: 'csharp', },
    { label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
await sdk.acceptTransfer({
  prevLink, // or traceId
});
```

Or:

```js
await sdk.rejectTransfer({
  prevLink, // or traceId
  data: {
    reason: "no way!",
  },
});
```

Alternatively, if you have initiated the transfer (push or pull), you can also before it has been accepted:

```js
await sdk.cancelTransfer({
  prevLink, // or traceId
});
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="csharp">

```cs
TransferResponseInput<Object> trInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(TraceId, null, null);
TraceState<Object, Object> stateAccept = await GetSdk().AcceptTransferAsync(trInput);
```

Or:

```cs
TransferResponseInput<Object> trInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(traceId, null, null);
TraceState<Object, Object> stateReject = await GetSdk().RejectTransferAsync(trInput);
```

Alternatively, if you have initiated the transfer (push or pull), you can also cancel before it has been accepted:

```cs
TransferResponseInput<Object> responseInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(TraceId, null, null);
TraceState<Object, Object> statecancel = await GetSdk().CancelTransferAsync(responseInput);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java">

```java
TransferResponseInput<Object> trInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(null,traceId);
TraceState<Object, Object> stateAccept = sdk.acceptTransfer(trInput);
```

Or:

```java
TransferResponseInput<Object> trInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(null, traceId);
TraceState<Object, Object> stateReject = sdk.rejectTransfer(trInput);
```

Alternatively, if you have initiated the transfer (push or pull), you can also cancel before it has been accepted:

```java
TransferResponseInput<Object> responseInput = new TransferResponseInput<Object>(null, traceId);
TraceState<Object, Object> stateCancel = sdk.cancelTransfer(responseInput);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In all cases, the arguments are:

- `data`: (optional) some data related to the pull transfer,
- `prevLink` or `traceId`.

The Sdk will return the new state object of the trace. The shape of this object is the same as explained [previously](#creating-a-new-trace).

Notes:

- The `data` object argument is optional. When it is provided, it is a free form object that will not be validated against a JSON schema.

### Trace stages

Your group in the workflow is composed of multiple stages. There are always 3 default stages:

- `Incoming`: this stage lists all the traces that are being transferred to your group (push or pull),
- `Backlog`: this stage lists all the traces that have been transferred to your group and accepted,
- `Outgoing`: this stage lists all the traces that are being transferred to another group (push or pull).

The other stages are called `Attestation` stages. They compose the logic of your group in the context of this workflow.

Notes:

- When someone pushes a trace to your group, it will appear in your `Incoming` stage and their `Outgoing` stage.
- When you accept a transfer, the trace will move to your `Backlog` stage.
- When you reject a transfer, the trace will move back to its previous `Attestation` stage and disappear from the `Outgoing` and `Incoming` stages it was in.
