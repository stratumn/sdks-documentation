## Action not allowed at one stage of te workflow

If an action is not allowed at one point of the workflow, you will get an error like :

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "action \"actionName\" not in next actions of \"groupName\"",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 17 }],
      "path": ["createLink"],
      "status": 400
    }
  ],
  "data": { "createLink": null }
}
```

In that case, you should verify if the action you are trying to perform should be done at this stage of te workflow,
and by the group you are trying to perform the action with.
If so, please contact the Stratum's support team.

## If the form data does not match the expected data

In that case, you will get an error like :

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Form data is not valid: [ should have required property propertyName]",
      "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 17 }],
      "path": ["createLink"],
      "status": 400
    }
  ],
  "data": { "createLink": null }
}
```

In that case, you should verify the specifications to check that the data you're sending is correct.
If so, please contact the Stratum's support team.
